Parts list:

Tetrahedron:
10', 1" pipes (steel?) x4 (how wide do they actually need to be?)
Pressure-treated plywood - 8'x4' sheet x4
    Ports of some sort in the sides for sound to escape
    Probably notch in one side for power to come in
        Some way to affix power cord to frame
2x4s for frame (hoping someone else can do frame design)
Spherical(?) cap for the top vertex (aesthetic and possibly reinforcing)
Some kind of fixtures for the pipes to fit into at the bottom, for stability
What's the bottom of the tetrahedron? Maybe just regular plywood?
Cover (flashing?) for top of tetrahedron

Globe:
3' of chain if we go from the top of the globe
    7' of chain if we go from the bottom
4' plastic sphere (awaiting quotes). Probably has 5 1/4" opening.
Some sort of reinforcement for where the chain meets the globe.
Alternately, *maybe*, some stiffer material than chain to prevent tetherball.

Sound:
Speakers (Justin)
Amplifier
iPod or equivalent, with charger
Power strip
Extension cord
Long audio cable to run up through pipe and down along chain

LEDs:
LED lights (8x blue, 8x red)
Microcontroller and accessories
How are we powering the LEDs? Do we need to run power cable to the globe also?
LCD displays x3 to show month and year

Accessories:
Faceless but eerily attractive business-casual woman

Still in question and up for discussion:
How best to convey info to viewers?
