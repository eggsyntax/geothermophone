Audio approach

1. Figure out how to parse gridded data from CDAS.
    - 1 file per variable. 33MB for monthly mean (for air temp, anyway). 
        Monthly or daily? Those could actually be two separate vars.

2. Write parser

3. Play with Zebra to find awesomest sound ever. Maybe I should get U-he's modular one. Or ableton's BEAP. But not today.

4. Output MIDI control data

5. Use Pipe(?) to record that control data in Live. Save file immediately!

6. Map to controls as desired.
